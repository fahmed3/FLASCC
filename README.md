## Eatables
Eatables takes a user's address to find restaurants near them, and allows them to search specific keywords for what they want. It returns a list of restaurants with their ratings, prices, and the times it would take to get there. The user can then select a restaurant and will be sent to a page with the restaurant's information, such as its description, its cuisine, or its menu - taken from the Zomato API. That page will also have directions to the chosen restaurant through the Google Maps API.

### How to Run
Clone the repo and run app.py. The API keys are provided in keys.json, the user does not need to input them. After running the program you can just enter your address and keywords and search for restaurants.
